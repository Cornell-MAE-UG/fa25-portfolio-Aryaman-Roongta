## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Aryaman Roongta, and I am a sophomore at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. I aspire to work in the automotive or motorsport industry as a development engineer, primarily inspired by my love for cars, and my work on the Cornell Racing FSAE team. 

When I am not turning wrenches in the garage or running structural simulations in the computer lab, I enjoy being a motorsport athlete, doing mountain biking, playing squash or volleyball, or watching Formula 1.
