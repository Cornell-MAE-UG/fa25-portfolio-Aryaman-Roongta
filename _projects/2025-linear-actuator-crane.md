For a class, we were asked to create a load-carrying crane that could one use 3 pin supports (two of which must be mounted on the ground), 1 linear actuator, and one rigid bar, all while being inside a bounding-box 2D design space that was 150cm long and 50cm tall. The goal was to maximize the mass the crane could carry in addition to the max height that the crane could lift that mass to. We had to find our linear actuator from Tolomatic.com

I chose an RSX actuator because it fit my design space while having the highest combined rated mass capabilities and highest extension. The structural design of the crane can be seen in the image to the left:
